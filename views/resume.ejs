            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <div>
            <p>I am a firm believer in pursuing what you want and being proactive about your goals. This outlook and determination has led me to pursue a career in software development after 8 years of working as a Registered Nurse. I always felt that I had other passions and finally discovered programming after trying out some online courses. I loved it so much that I decided to take the leap in 2021 and enroll in a program full time to gain the skills and experience I needed. I can apply my problem solving, analytical thinking and creativity skills in a way that I was not able to before. 
            </p> <br>
            <p>
              I have experience with Java, C++, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I am highly interested in both front and back end development and am currently taking courses for full stack web development. I have experience with relational databases and some knowledge with non-relational databases. I am ready to gain industry experience and apply my skills as a member of a development team!
